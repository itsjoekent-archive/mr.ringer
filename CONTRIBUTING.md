WIP. Check back soon!

## Local Development

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

This will rebuild the library on file-save and rerun unit tests. It is suggested to also install an editor extension for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) ([Atom](https://atom.io/packages/prettier-atom), [VS Code](https://github.com/prettier/prettier-vscode)).
